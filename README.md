# Overview of the Project #

 We try to determine similarity between users, images and locations using a dataset consisting of textual and visual descriptors of images which have been uploaded by users to Flickr. The project is broken up into three phases:

 1. **Phase 1**: Computed document similarity similarity, image similarity and location similarity with the help of visual and textual descriptors by utilising similarly measures such as Euclidean Distance and Cosine Similarity.â€©
 2. **Phase 2**: Applied latent semantic analysis using the techniques such as Principal Component Analysis, Singular Valued Decomposition and Latent Dirichlet allocation.
 3. **Phase 3**: Implemented measures to group data in order to find relationship between objects, rank the importance of nodes in a data set and also decrease the complexity of similarity searching from linear to sub-linear by using approximate index structures.

 # Technologies Used #
